  date: "TEDxYouth@PPSIJC - 2019"
  theme_name: "THE KNOWLEDGE ILLUSION"
  content: "What does it really take to fulfil the criteria of being categorised as knowledgeable? Do you think you are knowledgeable enough? 'Expert' enough? 
   <br><br>Quite interestingly, we are trapped in our inherent, dogmatic beliefs which revolve around the stated notions of the ways in which knowledge can be acquired, possessed, and demonstrated. Even on that one fine day, when a new, completely undiscovered horizon populates itself in front of us, we turn a blind eye towards it, since our eyelids are controlled by mankind's old friends: fear and security. We succumb to our need to be safe, at the cost of a manifestation which could potentially help us feel safer. And it is this fear of being unconventional and 'crazy', that we hope to spread awareness about."
