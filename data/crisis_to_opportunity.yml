  theme_name: "Crisis to Oppurtnity"
  content: "'In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity.' - Albert Einstein
  <br><br>From the Cold War that gave rise to the opportunity for humans to advance their knowledge of space to Steve Jobs utilising the time after he was ousted from his very own company to give birth to Pixar, thousands, if not millions, of people and organisations have time after time evidenced this fact. Needless to say, we are living amidst a crisis ourselves; one that has brought the world to its knees. And it is in such times that the realisation that opportunity goes hand-in-hand with crisis is of utmost relevance.<br><br>
It is quite conveniently said, but how can opportunities be there when very evidently everything around you seems to go haywire? And, if there are indeed opportunities, where exactly are they? Most importantly, how do you embrace adversity and fish out these so-called opportunities from the deep, dark ocean of crisis? These are the very questions we hope to answer with our transformative and invigorating talks. See you there!"
