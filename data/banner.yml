  theme_name: "CONCEPT TO CONCLUSION"
  event_date: "Date to be announced soon."
  content: "Have you ever had an idea which never reached fruition? An idea that never reached its truest potential? Powerhouses of ambition, these visionaries have found solace in the belief that one day, they will make it. Oprah Winfrey and Gautam adani are only two of the hundreds who have carried their concepts to conclusion, believing it to be the basis of the human race. <br><br> With our luminary speakers illuminating you about the art of executing our ideas to perfection, mesmerizing performances to bedazzle our eyes, memorable souvenirs to mark this blockbuster forum in our minds, we will celebrate the profundity and beauty of innovation and the metamorphosis of concepts blossoming into conclusions, here at TEDxYouth@PPSIJC. <br><br> At TEDxYouth@PPSIJC, we wish to dissect the anatomy of success as we find ourselves entering a new world, one where hope may seem like a luxury for many. Join us as we decipher the secret to fulfilling our prophecies:  renaissance, rebirth, revival. For the truth is, it’s not the idea, it’s never the idea, it’s always what you do with it."
